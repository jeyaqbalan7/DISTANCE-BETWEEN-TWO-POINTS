# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
First import math in program
### Step 2: 
Assign the given first and second coordinates to the list1 and list2 respectively
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Print the distance with two precision
### Step 5: 
End the program

### PROGRAM:
```

import math
a=[4,2]
b=[10,6]
dist=math.sqrt((b[0]-a[0])**2+(b[1]-a[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(dist))
```
  
### OUTPUT:
